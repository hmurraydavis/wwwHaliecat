                    <p>A way of connecting with those you care about without a screen.</p>
                    <p>Spectrum prioritizes incoming emails so the user can focus on the people and connections they care about. This lets them build relationships without being chained to a screen. </p>
                    <p>Design originally focused toward concussion patients; however after considering the distribution challenges associated with getting a product to users who only need it for 3 days, we decided to let the needs of concussions patients guide us as we designed a more generally applicable product. Ultimately, we designed Spectrum for people 25-40 who want to maintain their connections to people they care about, but already feel like that cannot escape the screen.</p>
                    <p>Halie worked to design Spectrum, made models of the physical device and the interaction between components, and created the working software prototype. </p>

                    <p>Researching in the field can be tough. Sometime it would be nice to have an extra hand. GEOD was designed to assist geologists with their field research in extreme environments.</p>
                    <p>Halie designed the arm and gripper for GEOD so it coud pick up tools and samples and reach the tool bed. It is actuated with four, geared-down motors located inside the body of the robot. Power from these actuators is transmitted to the various joints of the arm with cable tendons. Its design was inspired by the human arm.</p>

                    <p>A neato robot traversed a variety of obstacles including a bridge outlined in red lines, a tunnel, and dominos which it had to knock over. The robot moved through the obstacles with the assistance of fiducials to identify which obstacle it was attempting. </p>
                    <p>Halie worked on the overarching architecture of the system including the use of an primary finite state controller. This sets which challenge the robot attempts with imput from which fiducials is visible. Halie also worked extensively on traversing the bridge with computer vision using OpenCV and Python. To traverse the bridge, color filtering and thresholding were used. Then the largest gap was found and the robot steared toward the center of this gap. </p>

                    <p>Experimental validation that assuming theoretical enthalpy of combustion is reasonable for real world systems. </p>
                    <p>The reported enthalpy values assume complete combustion. This is not always a valid assumption. To see when this is a valid assumption, we burnt cotton in a bomb calorimeter and varied the amount of oxygen available for consumption. We found that the amount of oxygen available does affect the amount of energy released. If close to complete combustion occurs, the reported enthalpy of combustion is a reasonable assumption; however, in many cases, an audjustment should be made to account for the decreased energy released during incomplete combustion of a sample. </p>
